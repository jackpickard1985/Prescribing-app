# Prescribing-app
Android app for safe drug dose calculation, Kivy GUI, produced in Linux

This was produced for Luton and Dunstable NHS Foundation trust Neonatal Intensive Care department, where it was in constant use for many years

It provides drug dose calculations

Versions of this have been continually in use providing safer prescribing and drug administration to sick babies from 2017 until the present day (as of 3-3-2023)

I used an apk compiler called Buildozer which runs nicely in a Linux virtual machine; this worked much better than trying to do it in Windows
